# pygame
A dump for my experiments with PyGame

## How to Play
First you have to have a mac, or a linux machine, or at the very least you can
use a Windows machine.

Second, you need Python installed. This game works with Python 2.7 and is untested with 3.

Then you need to run:  pip install pygame

Now you can go to the game directory, and run `python reapy.py`

If things work, you are now playing a very broken video game with very stolen sprites I will probably get a cease and desist letter for.
