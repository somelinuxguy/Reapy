# pygame
A dump for my experiments with PyGame

## How to Play
First you have to have a mac, or a linux machine, or at the very least you can
use a Windows machine.

Second, you need Python installed. I have run this on Python 3, though I originally wrote it in 2.7. I recently got rid of the old version and upgraded to 3, and Reapy runs just fine for me. If you want to run it on Python 2.7 you will just need to comment out all the PRINT statements.

Then you need to run:  pip install pygame

Now you can go to the game directory, and run `python reapy.py`

If things work, you are now playing a very broken video game with very stolen sprites I will probably get a cease and desist letter for.
